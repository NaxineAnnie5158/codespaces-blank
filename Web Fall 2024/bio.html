		<h1>Annie Vo Biography</h1>
		<h3>My family</h3>
		<li>Mother</li>
		<li>Father</li>
		<li>Brother</li>
		<li>Dogs</li>
		<h3>Hobbies</h3>
		<li>Drawing</li>
		<p>I usually draw characters. My most used media is a simple ballpoint pen. The reason why I like using pen because they are cheap and easy to use. The fact that you can not erase it helps the beginner to learn how to sketch lightly.</p>
		<li>Painting</li>
		<p>I use acrylic paint, oil paint, and watercolor for my painting. I lean more into watercolor because it's much easier to travel it outside. My painting usually consists of characters and flowers as the subject.</p>
		<li>Playing videogames</li>
		<p>I love to play video games. My favorite genre of video games are RPG and Farming Simulators. My usually comfort games are the Final Fantasy series, but I am willing to try any other games...that is not a FPS games. I hate those.</p>
		<h3>Education</h3>
		<p>Major: Painting and Drawing in Anderson University.</p>
